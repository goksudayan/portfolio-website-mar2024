className=\"section-description black\">Problem Statement</h3>\n\n        <p>One of the worst inefficiencies in the world is hiring processes that end with candidates' rejection: <span className=\"highlighted-text\">Companies use very valuable resources, which they get zero return on investment, and most of the time, candidates get no feedback and spend their time in very repetitive interviews.</span></p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"section-description black\">Solution</h3>\n\n        <img src={Roles} style = { { width: '100%' }} />\n\n        <p>Introducing external evaluators, a new role to the standard hiring equation: They evaluate job seekers' application packages and create extensive reports on them. These reports are shared with job seekers; thus they finally get feedback that they have been looking for for a long time and can be shared with the hiring responsible in the companies that are interested in the job seeker in return for financial compensation.</p>\n\n        <p>Furthermore, companies that evaluated a candidate and spent valuable resources in the process can assume the role of external evaluators, and monetize their own evaluation reports, which enable them to get a return on their investment. Last but not least, any company purchasing such reports can significantly reduce the time and resources they spend on hiring processes.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <SectionHeader description={\"02 / 04 | RESEARCH\"} />\n\n      <div className=\"content-container\" id=\"research\">\n\n        <h3 className=\"section-description black\">Solution</h3>\n\n        <p>To understand the problems job seekers face before, during, and after the hiring processes they go through, I interviewed two people who were actively looking for a job and had interviewed within the last thirty days.</p>\n\n        <p>Both stated that:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n          <li>Most interviews they participated in were highly repetitive.</li>\n          <li>They barely get feedback from companies they are rejected from.</li>\n          <li>They would love to get feedback.</li>\n          <li>They believe such feedback would help them to do much better in future interviews.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3 className=\"section-description black\">Questionnaires</h3>\n\n        <p>To reach a broader population to verify these statements, see what other problems job seekers face, and understand the landscape better, I decided to conduct user questionnaires.</p>\n\n        <p><span className=\"highlighted-text\">One questionnaire for juniors and active job seekers with less than three years of experience and another for seniors with hiring responsibilities with at least three years of experience were prepared. In total, 34 questions were asked, and 9 individuals participated.</span></p>\n\n        <p>Key learnings from this study consists of:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n          <li>Job seekers truly care about feedback on their application packages and interviews.</li>\n          <li>Some job seekers find it tedious to record long answers to one-way interview questions.</li>\n          <li>A very high percentage of participants (85.7%) prefer using their computers for one-way interviews.</li>\n          <li>Job seekers prefer to tailor their application packages per company as different companies value different things.</li>\n          <li>Most seniors with hiring responsibilities would provide feedback if they had enough resources and time.</li>\n          <li>Job seekers and hiring responsible have a much higher preference for one-way interviews.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3 className=\"section-description black\">Eureka!</h3>\n\n        <p>Back to the whiteboard, I decided to go over four key points I learned by then:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n          <li>There is a market (i.e., supply and demand) for career consultancy services.</li>\n          <li>Seniors and companies would provide feedback if they had enough resources or had been incentivized strongly.</li>\n          <li>Job seekers love feedback on their application packages.</li>\n          <li>A hiring process that ends with the rejection of a candidate to whom no feedback is provided is extremely inefficient.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>During a brainstorming session, I noticed that a new role, “external evaluator”, could be introduced to the standard hiring equation between job seekers and companies, immensely improving the current hiring practices.</p>\n        \n        <img src={Roles} style = { { width: '100%' }} />\n  \n        <p><span className=\"highlighted-text\">An external evaluator would provide extensive feedback on a job seeker's application package and get financially compensated for their time and effort. A job seeker would get extensive feedback, by allowing the external evaluator to share and monetize the extensive report they create, and companies would be able to purchase these reports, significantly reducing the resources they spend on job candidates, and/or sell their own reports on candidates they had rejected.</span></p>\n\n        <p>Most importantly, any person can assume any combination of these three roles under certain circumstances.</p>\n\n        <p>As an outcome of this new hiring process, job seekers' interviews become less repetitive, they get more feedback, hand-selected pioneers of their fields can provide feedback to job seekers and monetize their efforts, and companies finally have a way to “recycle” their efforts and reports on rejected candidates.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <SectionHeader description={\"03 / 04 | Primary Features\"} />\n\n      <div className=\"content-container\" id=\"primary-features\"></div>\n\n      <div className=\"horizontal\">\n\n        <div className=\"bento-introduction\" style= { { backgroundColor: 'white', width: '50%', padding: '1.5em'}}>\n\n            <img src={FeatureOne} style= { { width: '40%' } } />\n            <div className=\"content-container\" style= { { backgroundColor: 'white', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '0.5em'}}>\n              <h3 className=\"section-description black\">Easy-to-use One-way Interview Platform</h3>\n              <p>Companies and candidates can use VidBib as a one-way interview platform.
